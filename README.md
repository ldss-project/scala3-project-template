[TODO: change description]: #
This repository is a template for a Scala3 project, which includes code styling
([ScalaFormatter](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/)) and code linting tools 
([WartRemover](https://www.wartremover.org/)). 

The project starts with preconfigured continuous integration for testing and 
deployment of **sources** and **documentation** on both GitHub and Maven Central.

In the case of **executable** artifacts, a configuration for publishing a Docker
image is also provided.
